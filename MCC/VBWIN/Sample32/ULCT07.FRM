' Purpose:                      Operate the counter.

' Demonstration:                Resets and reads the event counter.

' Other Library Calls:          cbErrHandling%()

' Special Requirements:         Board 0 must have an Event Counter, such as
'                               the miniLAB 1008 and the PMD-1208LS.

   ' after a call to the library. If it is not equal to 0, an error has occurred.
