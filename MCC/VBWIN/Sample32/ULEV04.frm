' Library Call Demonstrated:    cbEnableEvent - ON_SCAN_ERROR
'                                             - ON_END_OF_AO_SCAN
'                               cbDisableEvent()
'

' Purpose:                      Paces a waveform out channel 0 using cbAOutScan.
'                               At scan start, it sets the digital output high, and
'                               upon scan completion, it sets the digital output low.
'                               Fatal errors such as UNDERRUN errors, cause the scan
'                               to be aborted.
'
' Demonstration:                Shows how to enable and respond to events.

' Other Library Calls:          cbAOutScan()
'                               cbErrHandling()
'                               cbDOut()

' Special Requirements:         Board 0 must support event handling, paced analog outputs,
'                               and cbDOut.
