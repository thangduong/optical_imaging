' Library Call Demonstrated:    cbFlashLED%()

' Purpose:                      Flashes onboard LED for visual identification.

' Other Library Calls:          cbErrHandling%()

' Special Requirements:         Board 0 must have an external LED,
'										  such as the miniLAB 1008 and PMD-1208LS.
'

Sub Form_Load ()

   ' Initiate error handling
   '  activating error handling will trap errors like
   '  bad channel numbers and non-configured conditions.
   '  Parameters:
   '    PRINTALL    :all warnings and errors encountered will be printed
   '    DONTSTOP    :if an error is encountered, the program will not stop,
   '                 errors must be handled locally
   ULStat% = cbErrHandling(PRINTALL, DONTSTOP)
   If ULStat% <> 0 Then Stop

   ' If cbErrHandling% is set for STOPALL or STOPFATAL during the program
   ' design stage, Visual Basic will be unloaded when an error is encountered.
   ' We suggest trapping errors locally until the program is ready for compiling
   ' to avoid losing unsaved data during program design.  This can be done by
   ' setting cbErrHandling options as above and checking the value of ULStat%
   ' after a call to the library. If it is not equal to 0, an error has occurred.
