' Library Call Demonstrated:    cbEnableEvent - ON_SCAN_ERROR
'                                             - ON_DATA_AVAILABLE
'                                             - ON_END_OF_AI_SCAN
'                               cbDisableEvent()
'

' Purpose:                      Scans a single channel and displays the latest
'                               sample acquired every EventSize or more samples.
'                               Also updates the latest sample upon scan completion
'                               or end. Fatal errors such as OVERRUN errors, cause
'                               the scan to be aborted.

' Demonstration:                Shows how to enable and respond to events.

' Other Library Calls:          cbErrHandling()
'                               cbAInScan()
'
' Special Requirements:         Board 0 must support event handling and have
'                               paced analog inputs.
