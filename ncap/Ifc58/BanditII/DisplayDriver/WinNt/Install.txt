DRIVER INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
     

      Log on the workstation as an administrator or with an account which has
      administrator privileges on the workstation.

      From the MAIN group in the Program Manager window, start the "Control
      Panel" program.

      Start the "Display" control panel applet program. 

      If the driver has never been installed on the system, select the button
      labeled "Change Display Type...".  From the "Display Type" dialog box,
      select the "Change..." button.  From the "Select Device" dialog box,
      select the "Other..." button.

      From the "Select Device" dialog box, select the resolution you would like.
      Select the "Install" button.  Windows NT Setup will copy the miniport
      driver and the display driver to the proper directories on your system.

      The "Windows NT Setup" program will display a dialog box asking you to
      enter the path where the actual files exist.  Enter the same path and
      press the <ENTER> key:

	  Example:  a:\

      If you are instead prompted with a question to use 'Current' or 'New'
      drivers, select 'New', then enter the path.

      Reboot the system after exiting the "Windows NT Setup" program.

      After the system is rebooted, you will be able to go back into the Control
      Panel Display applet and select and test an alternate screen resolution.
